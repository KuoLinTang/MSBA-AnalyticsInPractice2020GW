# Analytics In Practice Group Project (MSBA 2020/21)

## Transaction Prediction

### Background:
You are working for an analytics consultancy company. A bank, “Universal Plus”, has approached your company to request you to pitch to win a major contract with them to develop and deploy a customer transaction prediction system. This system is required to predict which customers will make a specific transaction in the future. Having such a system will ensure that Universal Plus can take proactive steps to improve their customers’ satisfaction before they would take their business elsewhere. In other words, the managers’ aim is to keep their promising customers. Several other consultancy companies have been approached as well, and the final decision on who will get the contract will largely depend on the outcome of a demonstration of the consultancy’s approach to this problem based on a dataset that the bank provided.

The dataset contains customer transactions. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, the bank cannot provide the original features (variable names) and more background information about the data. There are 100,000 records and 200 anonymised numerical variables denoted by “var_0”, “var_1”, …, “var_199”. Variable “ID_code” corresponds to the customer ID and “target” is the target variable and it takes value 1 if the specific transaction is made and 0 otherwise.
